# aiagentcliwrappers

## Summary
Implement AI agent CLI detection and loop commands: 1) nimsforestwork-hello-agents - detects available AI CLI tools (claude, gemini-cli, cursor, etc.) and shows which loop commands will work, 2) Individual loop commands (nimsforestwork-loop-claude, nimsforestwork-loop-gemini) that execute 'execute NIMINSTRUCTIONS.md' in 3-minute intervals with sleep. Each agent needs its own terminal for proper isolation. Perfect for git worktree distributed Nim collaboration.
