## üöÄ Quick Setup: Transform Any Repo into a Git Worktree Workspace

### Step-by-Step Example with "justanothertodoapp"

Let's say you have a project called `justanothertodoapp`:

```bash
# 1. You're currently in your project directory
cd /home/user/justanothertodoapp
pwd
# Output: /home/user/justanothertodoapp

# 2. Add nimsforestwork to your project
git clone https://github.com/nimsforest/nimsforestwork.git tools/nimsforestwork

# 3. Set up the workspace (this moves your repo!)
WORKSPACE_ROOT=/home/user/justanothertodoapp-workspace make -f tools/nimsforestwork/MAKEFILE.nimsforestwork nimsforestwork-setup-workspace

# 4. Your project is now organized as a workspace
cd /home/user/justanothertodoapp-workspace
```

### What Just Happened?

**Before:**
```
/home/user/justanothertodoapp/     # Your repo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/
```

**After:**
```
/home/user/justanothertodoapp-workspace/     # New workspace
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/                                    # Your repo moved here
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/nimsforestwork/                    # Work management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work/                                    # Work items
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENTINSTRUCTIONS.md                     # AI agent setup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile                                 # Workspace commands
```

### üå≥ Ready for Git Worktrees

```bash
# Create feature branches as separate directories
cd /home/user/justanothertodoapp-workspace/main
git worktree add ../feature-auth origin/feature-auth
git worktree add ../bug-fix-login origin/bug-fix-login

# Your workspace now looks like:
# justanothertodoapp-workspace/
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/              # main branch
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-auth/      # feature branch
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bug-fix-login/     # bug fix branch
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work/              # shared work management
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/             # shared tools
```

## üìù WORKSPACE_ROOT Explained

**WORKSPACE_ROOT** = Where you want the new workspace folder created

### Examples:

| Your Project | WORKSPACE_ROOT | Result |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| `/home/user/myapp` | `/home/user/myapp-workspace` | Workspace at `/home/user/myapp-workspace/` |
| `/code/backend-api` | `/code/backend-api-workspace` | Workspace at `/code/backend-api-workspace/` |
| `C:\dev\frontend` | `C:\dev\frontend-workspace` | Workspace at `C:\dev\frontend-workspace\` |

### Convention:
- **Project**: `{name}`
- **Workspace**: `{name}-workspace` (recommended)

## üìã Workflow Documentation

NimsforestWork implements a comprehensive issue management and product development workflow that supports the complete lifecycle from customer support to production delivery.

**üìñ [Read the complete workflow documentation](WORKFLOW.md)**

Key features:
- **Issue Intake**: Systematic processing of customer support tickets
- **Product Backlog**: Complete lifecycle from analysis to production
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure quality while maintaining agility
- **State Management**: Clear progression through development stages
- **Business Rating**: Priority-based work management
- **Release Management**: Structured release process

The workflow supports bugs, change requests, new features, and documentation improvements through a unified process.

## Alternative Setup Methods

### 1. Traditional Project Integration (No Workspace)

```bash
# Add nimsforestwork as a submodule in tools/nimsforestwork
git submodule add https://github.com/nimsforest/nimsforestwork.git tools/nimsforestwork

# Navigate to the submodule directory
cd tools/nimsforestwork

# Run initial setup
make nimsforestwork-hello

# Return to project root and initialize
cd ../../
make nimsforestwork-init
```

### 2. Available Commands

- `make nimsforestwork-hello` - Check system compatibility
- `make nimsforestwork-init` - Initialize work folder structure  
- `make nimsforestwork-newissue` - Create new work item interactively
- `make nimsforestwork-lint` - Validate all work items

## AI Agent Integration

### For Developers Using AI Tools

Simply tell your AI agent:

```
Please read pkg/nimsforestwork/AGENTINSTRUCTIONS.md and follow those instructions for all development work.
```

The AI agent will then automatically:
- Create work items before starting any development
- Move work items through proper workflow states  
- Follow the Netflix deployment model
- Document the "why" behind every change

### Supported AI Tools

This works with any AI coding assistant:
- **Claude Code** - `"Read pkg/nimsforestwork/AGENTINSTRUCTIONS.md and follow those instructions"`
- **Cursor** - Same instruction in system prompt
- **GitHub Copilot** - Include instruction in comments
- **Gemini CLI** - Pass instruction as context
- **Any AI tool** - The instructions are self-contained

## Work Item System

### Work Types

- **changerequests/** - Modify existing functionality
- **bugs/** - Fix broken functionality (has `pendingfeedback/` state)
- **proposals/** - Add new functionality  
- **improvedocumentation/** - Improve documentation

### Workflow States

1. **new/** - Newly created items
2. **planned/** - Reviewed and accepted for implementation
3. **active/** - Currently being worked on
4. **pendingfeedback/** - Blocked waiting for clarification (bugs/changerequests only)
5. **ready/** - Implementation complete, ready for merge
6. **archive/** - Completed items

### Creating Work Items

```bash
# Interactive creation (recommended)
make nimsforestwork-newissue

# Manual creation
cp docs/work/changerequests/template.md docs/work/changerequests/new/myfeature.md
# Edit the file, then commit
git add docs/work/changerequests/new/myfeature.md
git commit -m "work: add my feature request"
```

### Moving Through Workflow

```bash
# Plan the work
git mv docs/work/changerequests/new/myfeature.md docs/work/changerequests/planned/
git commit -m "work: plan my feature implementation"

# Start working  
git mv docs/work/changerequests/planned/myfeature.md docs/work/changerequests/active/
git commit -m "work: start my feature implementation"

# Complete work
git mv docs/work/changerequests/active/myfeature.md docs/work/changerequests/ready/
git commit -m "work: my feature ready for review"

# After merge to main
git mv docs/work/changerequests/ready/myfeature.md docs/work/changerequests/archive/
git commit -m "work: completed my feature"
```

## Netflix Deployment Model

- **Every merge to main goes directly to production**
